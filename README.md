        - Get it by following HubSpot's [step-by-step guide](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/guides/apps/private-apps/overview) on how to create a private app
        - make sure you have the following scopes configured:
            - `crm.objects.contacts.read`
            - `crm.objects.contacts.write`
            - `crm.objects.deals.read`
            - `crm.objects.deals.write`
            - `crm.schemas.contacts.read`
            - `crm.schemas.contacts.write`
            - `crm.schemas.deals.read`
            - `crm.schemas.deals.write`

## Running the Application

All services are containerized and orchestrated with Docker Compose.

1. **Start all services**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```
2. **Backend (Server)**

   ```bash
   docker compose exec server sh
   npm install         # if first time
   npm run dev         # launches the server in development mode
   ```
3. **Frontend (Client)**

   ```bash
   docker compose exec client sh
   npm install              # if first time
   npm run setup-hubspot    # if first time, setup hubspot with required properties and groups
   npm run dev              # launches the NextJS app in development mode
   ```

Once both services are running, open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Additional Tips

### Running Tests
1. **Backend (Server)**

    ```bash
   npm run test
   ```

2. **Frontend (Client)**

    ```bash
    npm run test
    ```


### Inspect Database
1. **Pgadmin**
    * If you want to inspect database details, you can open pgadmin via the url [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)
    * If you haven't changed your .env file, you should be able to log in with these credentials `admin@user.com` and `secret`
    * Register a server with this connection configuration (default .env config):
        - Address: `localhost`
        - Database: `forex`
        - Username: `postgres`
        - Password: `postgres`
2. **PSQL**
    * If you want to use the psql cli, run the command:
        ```bash
        docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d forex
        ```
    * Command example:
        ```SQL
        SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'users';
        ```

### Inspect Redis

Run the command:
```bash
docker compose exec redis redis-cli
```
